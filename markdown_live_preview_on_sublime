  Thanks for installing MarkdownLivePreview! I hope you'll enjoy using it!

  Quick Start:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To enable MarkdownLivePreview, you need to be on a markdown view (works with
  Markdown Extended). Then just press `alt+m`, or search up in the command
  palette(cntr+shift+p): 'MarkdownLivePreview: Toggle'. Hit enter and you're done. As soon as
  you type anything in, it'll show up with the preview in a new group.

  Say thanks:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can do so by staring the GitHub repo, or sending a tweet (@_math2001) for
  example!

  Troubles?

  the GitHub issue tracker here:
